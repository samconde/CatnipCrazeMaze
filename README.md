# CatnipCrazeMaze
Game 202 Midterm Project; Interfacing arduino alternative controller with Unity to become a Catnip addicted Kitty going through a maze -- Co-op game, up to 4 players!

## About
Catnip Craze Maze is a local co-op game, up to 4 players, where you help Marley the Cat get through a maze to get enough catnip to satisfy him! The more catnip he collects, the faster Marley can move through the maze!

Marley is surrounded by 4 arrows all shining different colors â€” green, red, blue, and yellow. Each player controls one arrow with the button corresponding to the color. Players need to communicate to decide when and where Marley should move.

Be careful though! The location of the colored arrows can rotate at random times, so watch out on where your color will land next!
